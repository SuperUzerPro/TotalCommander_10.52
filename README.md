Total Commander 10.52 - 32+64 bit for Windows XP/Vista/7/8/8.1/10/11 32+64-bit

To install Total Commander, just run the tc*.exe self-extracting installer.

If you have installed a previous version of Total Commander or Wincmd (old
name), you can install the new version to the same directory without removing
the previous version. You can remove an old wincmd version AFTERWARDS with
tcuninst.exe.

What is Total Commander?

Total Commander (former Wincmd) is a file manager for Windows, a tool like the
Windows Explorer, which comes with windows. But Total Commander uses a
different approach: it has two fixed windows, which makes copying files much
easier.

Total Commander is shareware. The shareware version is freely distributable, 
as long as it is unchanged!

Here some key features of Total Commander:

Removing Total Commander: Double click tcuninst.exe/tcunin64.exe !

Installation BY HAND: If the installation fails for any reason, unpack the
INSTALL.CAB file with a CAB unpacker (e.g. CABVIEW from Microsoft) into a
empty directory, e.g. c:\totalcmd. Files in subdir e\ need to be moved to
the dir where totalcmd.exe/totalcmd64.exe is located.

Removal by hand: If you remove the program (totalcmd dir), also delete the
files wincmd.ini and wcx_ftp.ini in your settings directory! See menu Help -
About Total Commander for their location.
